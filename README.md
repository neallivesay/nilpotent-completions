# Explicit upper nilpotent completions

This project contains an implementation (written in Python3 and NumPy) of the algorithm specified in the following research article:

> TBA.

## Short description

Let `r` and `n` be positive integers with `r<n`. Define `N_r` to be the `n` by `n` matrix with ones on the `r`th subdiagonal and zeroes elsewhere. Note that `N_r` is nilpotent, i.e., there exists a positive integer `k` such that `N_r^k==0`.

Let `p` be an integer partition of `n`. 

## Mathematical Prerequisites

To understand this project, it should be sufficient 

This algorithm generates upper nilpotent completions for the matrix $N_r$, the $n\times n$ matrix with ones on the $r$th (where $0<r<n$) subdiagonal and zeroes elsewhere.
